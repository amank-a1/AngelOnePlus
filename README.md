## Problem Statement
- F&O trading is growing rapidly in comparison to the equity segment in our current system, but we lack special features for F&O traders
- The screenshot below shows how turnover is divided among various categories like equity, F&O, and commodities.
- Over 90% of our turnover comes from the F&O segment, as evident.

Option trading is a complex financial instrument with multiple strategies and payoffs. Understanding the payoff graph for multiple positions can be a daunting task, especially for beginners.

Our solution aims to simplify this by providing an intuitive GUI-based application that visualizes option payoffs using the QT framework, helping traders make more informed decisions.

## Approach
- **GUI Design**: User-friendly interface with input fields for option parameters and a visualization pane.
- **Mathematical Logic**: Calculates payoffs based on user inputs and chosen strategies.
- **Visualization**: Represents payoffs across a range of stock prices using graphs, providing clear insights.

## Features
- Intuitive input fields for option parameters.
